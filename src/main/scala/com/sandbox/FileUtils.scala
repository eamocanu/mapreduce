      |A Wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
      |constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.
      |A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that
      |every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret;
      |that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that
      |every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there,
      |is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it!
      |Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to
      |this.  No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved,
      |and vainly hope in time to read it all.  No more can I look into the
      |depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights
      |glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other
      |things submerged.  It was appointed that the book should shut with a
      |a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page.  It was
      |appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when
      |the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the
      |shore.  My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling
      |of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and
      |perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality,
      |and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end.  In any of the
      |burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper
      |more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost
      |personality, to me, or than I am to them?""".stripMargin
